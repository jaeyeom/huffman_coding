Simple text example for huffman coding. This should be long enough to
make this huffman coding useful. Because of the frequency file,
huffman encoding will actually increase the total size, if the input
is too short.

The sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" may not be
very good for huffman coding.
